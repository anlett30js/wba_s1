GraphQL was open sourced three years ago, and released within the context of a client/front-end ecosystem: React. GraphQL has strong adoption and momentum within these front-end communities. GraphQL was also released into a world moving quickly towards fine-grained microservices. As a result, most GraphQL server-side implementations are thin integration layers over REST APIs or microservices that require minimal changes to existing backend architectures.
